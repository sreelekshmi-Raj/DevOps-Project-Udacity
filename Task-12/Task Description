Automate the Continuous Integration stages using GitHub Actions(to build, test, and package an application)

Use GitHub action to run test to python helloworld application.
Application: app.py
Requirements for this application : requirements.txt
Test for the application : test_with_pytest.py
Github Action/workflow : pytest.yml file within the .github/workflows directory.

To trigger the workflow a new commit is necessary (e.g. editing the README.md fie).Once committed github actions are triggered.
For the event  go to Aactions tab in github then pytest workflow.
Check on the latest commit and find the pytest against different python version.We can see more verbose output for all the events that run.
